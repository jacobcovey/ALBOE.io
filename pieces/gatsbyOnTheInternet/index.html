      <p>
        When I was assigned to read The Great Gatsby, as a high school student, I figured I would just read a summary online (I have great regret for not reading many of the classics that were assigned to me in public school). Maybe there were a couple chapters teenage me skipped<span class='bs-mode'> (wouldn’t put it by the bastard)</span>, but I remember being enthralled by the book and the characters. It was an important step for me realizing how much I undervalued classic novels, and literature in general.
      </p>

      <p>
        In late 2021 I decided a book in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain' target='_blank' id >public domain</a> would be the perfect project for a native HTML CSS JS project. For several reasons The Great Gatsby was the obvious choice, but in the end I picked it because I was excited to read it again. It didn’t disappoint.
      </p>

        Gatsby on The Internet is a single .html file containing all the templating (HTML) styling (CSS) and scripting (Javascript) required for a complete web-book experience including automatic place keeping, passage search, light/dark themes, adjustable text size, and more. It's responsive and designed to look good on all screen sizes. The title and author name graphics are embedded SVG’s I made to match the typography on the first edition cover. Everything is native HTML/CSS/JS no third party frameworks or libraries. The file size comes in at less than .5 MB (a plain .mobi version of the book comes in at .64 MB).
      </p>

      <p>
        In a way I consider this is my love letter to the modern web tools/technologies. Thanks to all the hard working humans involved in the excruciating process of creating and updating <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_standards' target='_blank' id >web standards</a>. Also thanks to The Gutenberg Project. I started project with their plain HTML version of the Great Gatsby. They have over 60,000 public domain books they share on their website <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/' target='_blank' id >gutenberg.org</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m writing this after just finishing the beta version. I plan to re-read the entire book again on <a href='/pieces/gatsbyOnTheInternet/gatsbyOnTheInternet.html' target="_blank">GatsbyOnTheInternet.com</a> as a final QA pass. I also will spend time refactoring the code. Once it’s deemed “complete” I plan on minting it as NFT. More on that later.
